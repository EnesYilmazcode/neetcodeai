# NeetCode Complexity Analyzer Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that analyzes the time and space complexity of your coding solutions using Google's Gemini AI API. Perfect for NeetCode and LeetCode practice!

## Features

- üß† **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Google Gemini to analyze code complexity
- ‚ö° **Real-time Code Detection**: Automatically detects code from various editors
- üí° **Optimization Suggestions**: Shows optimal complexity when your solution isn't optimal
- üé® **Beautiful UI**: Modern, gradient-based interface
- üîí **Secure**: API key stored locally in your browser

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get a Free Google Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### 3. Configure the Extension

1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Paste your Gemini API key in the input field
3. The key will be saved automatically

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to a coding problem**: Go to NeetCode.io or LeetCode.com
2. **Write your solution**: Code your solution in the editor
3. **Analyze complexity**: Click the extension icon and press "Analyze Code Complexity"
4. **View results**: See the time and space complexity analysis
5. **Get optimization tips**: If your solution isn't optimal, you'll see suggestions

## Supported Websites

- ‚úÖ NeetCode.io
- ‚úÖ LeetCode.com
- üîÑ More coding platforms can be added

## Code Detection

The extension automatically detects code from various editor types:
- Monaco Editor (VS Code-style)
- CodeMirror
- Ace Editor  
- Standard textareas
- Custom coding platform editors

## Example Output

```
‚è±Ô∏è The time complexity is O(n¬≤)
üíæ The space complexity is O(1)

üí° Optimization Suggestion:
‚è±Ô∏è Optimal time complexity: O(n log n)
üíæ Optimal space complexity: O(1)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No code found on this page"
- Make sure you're on a supported coding website
- Ensure there's code in the editor
- Try refreshing the page and reloading the extension

### "API Error"
- Check that your Gemini API key is correct
- Ensure you have internet connection
- Verify the API key hasn't expired

### Extension not working
- Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
